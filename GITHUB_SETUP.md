# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

This guide helps you set up the Docusense OCR Prototype on GitHub and configure it for optimal collaboration.

## 🚀 Initial Repository Setup

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. **Log in to GitHub** and navigate to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. **Repository Details**:
   - **Name**: `docusense-ai` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: `Advanced Local OCR Service with multi-format support and REST API`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private based on your needs
   - **Initialize**: Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

### 2. Initial Commit and Push

From your local project directory, run these commands:

```bash
# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files (respecting .gitignore)
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Docusense OCR Prototype with advanced OCR settings and REST API"

# Connect to GitHub repository 
git remote add origin https://github.com/chandranshusingh/docusense-ai.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Repository Configuration

#### Enable Important Features
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings** tab
3. Enable these features:
   - **Issues**: For bug tracking and feature requests
   - **Wiki**: For extended documentation (optional)
   - **Discussions**: For community Q&A (optional)

#### Branch Protection (Recommended)
1. Go to **Settings** → **Branches**
2. Add rule for `main` branch:
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Restrict pushes to matching branches

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### For Contributors
1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Clone** your fork locally
3. **Create** a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
4. **Make** changes following the project guidelines
5. **Test** thoroughly (maintain pylint 10.0/10.0 score)
6. **Commit** with descriptive messages
7. **Push** to your fork: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
8. **Create** a Pull Request

### For Maintainers
1. **Review** pull requests carefully
2. **Test** all changes across supported file formats
3. **Ensure** pylint score remains 10.0/10.0
4. **Update** documentation as needed
5. **Merge** using squash commits for cleaner history

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Important Security Notes
- This is a **prototype application** for local use only
- **Never deploy** to public servers without proper security hardening
- **No authentication** is implemented (intentional for prototype)
- Only use in **trusted environments**

### Reporting Security Issues
If you discover security vulnerabilities:
1. **Do NOT** open public issues for security problems
2. **Email** the maintainers directly at: chandranshu.singh@outlook.com
3. **Provide** detailed description and reproduction steps
4. **Allow** reasonable time for fixes before disclosure

## 📊 Project Management

### Issue Labels
Consider creating these labels for better organization:
- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `enhancement` - New feature or request
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Looking for community help
- `question` - Further information is requested

### Milestones
Suggested milestones based on the implementation plan:
- Phase 1-3: Core OCR functionality
- Phase 4-5: Advanced settings and multi-format support
- Phase 6-7: REST API and documentation
- Future: Production readiness features

## 🎯 Next Steps

After setting up the repository:

1. **Test the setup** by cloning the repository to a new location
2. **Follow the README.md** installation instructions
3. **Verify** all functionality works as expected
4. **Create** your first issue or enhancement request
5. **Share** the repository with potential users/contributors

## 📞 Support

- **Issues**: Use GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests
- **Discussions**: Use GitHub Discussions for questions and community support
- **Documentation**: Check the `docs/` folder for detailed guides
- **Testing**: Follow `docs/Testing_Guide.md` for comprehensive testing
